Define your menu in your main controller.

Basic example one level menu
:     $scope.menus = {
:         main: [
:             {label: "Home",  state: "home"},
:             {label: "Blog",  state: "blogs"},
:             {label: "Contact Us",  state: "contactus"},

:         ]
:     }



Full example with three levels.
:     $scope.menus = {
:         main: [
:             {label: "Costings Menu...",  link: "costings"},
:             {label: "Settings Menu...",  link: "settings"}
:         ],
:         costings:  [
:             {label: "Main",      breadcrumb: "main"},
:             {label: "Invoices",  state: "invoices"}
:         ],
:         settings:  [
:             {label: "Main",      breadcrumb: "main"},
:             {label: "Accounting Menu...",link: "settings_accounting"},
:             {label: "Account",   state: "account"}
:         ],
:         settings_accounting: [
:             {label: "Main",      breadcrumb: "main"},
:             {label: "Settings",  breadcrumb: "settings"},
:             {label: "Profile",   state: "profile"}
:         ]
:     }
